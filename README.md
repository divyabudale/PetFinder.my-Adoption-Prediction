# PetFinder.my-Adoption-Prediction
In this competition you will predict the speed at which a pet is adopted, based on the petâ€™s listing on PetFinder. Sometimes a profile represents a group of pets. In this case, the speed of adoption is determined by the speed at which all of the pets are adopted. The data included text, tabular, and image data

AdoptionSpeed
Contestants are required to predict this value. The value is determined by how quickly, if at all, a pet is adopted. The values are determined in the following way:
0 - Pet was adopted on the same day as it was listed.
1 - Pet was adopted between 1 and 7 days (1st week) after being listed.
2 - Pet was adopted between 8 and 30 days (1st month) after being listed.
3 - Pet was adopted between 31 and 90 days (2nd & 3rd month) after being listed.
4 - No adoption after 100 days of being listed. (There are no pets in this dataset that waited between 90 and 100 days).

Submissions are scored based on the quadratic weighted kappa, which measures the agreement between two ratings
